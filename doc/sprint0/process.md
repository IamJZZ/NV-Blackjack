Decision Making: 

Big decisions about design will be made by Product Owner. Team will have great influence on the development decisions through coordination in meetings. Most decisions will be left up to users to make implementation decisions for their user stories.

User Stories:

User stories will be assigned to members in meeting at the beginning of each sprint. Most important user stories will be assigned first, stories are ordered in the product backlog from most important to least. Members get the opportunity in meetings to volunteer or choose the user stories they want to implement. User stories may be completed by multiple members depending on circumstances.

Meetings:

Scrum master conducts meetings. Meeting will occur every even numbered days at 8:00pm EST on discord. Everyone should attend all meetings, but exceptions will be made. Every person should attend all meetings unless valid reason is given for absence. Members that miss more than 25% of meetings will be contacted and possibly informed to TA. 

Next Step:

We have our first meeting for sprint 1 meeting on 8:00pm EST Wednesday Febuary 2nd. The first meeting will likely be about an hour or two as we will begin to make decisions on who will implement the user stories and continue with regular meetings afterwards.
