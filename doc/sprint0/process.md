Decision Making: 

Big decisions about design will be proposed by Product Owner. Team will have great influence on the development decisions through coordination in meetings. Decisions will be approved with a simple majority agreement by memebers. Most decisions within user stories will be left up to each member to make their own implementation decisions for their user stories, provied it will not interfere with other member's user stories.

User Stories:

User stories will be assigned to members in meeting at the beginning of each sprint. The user stories will be seperated into 3 types, which are app interface related user stories, user account related user stories, and gameplay related user stories. The most important user stories will be assigned first, stories are ordered in the product backlog from most important to least. The most most important user stories will be the user stories that are considered to be foundations for other user stories.  Members get the opportunity in meetings to volunteer or choose the user stories they want to implement. User stories may be completed by multiple members depending on circumstances.

Meetings:

Scrum master conducts meetings. Meeting will occur every even numbered days at 8:00pm EST on discord. Everyone should attend all meetings, but exceptions will be made. Every person should attend all meetings unless valid reason is given for absence. During meetings, each group member should state their progress in between each meetings. After listenig to other member's progress, each member will also provide their objective to be completed for the next meeting. Members that miss more than 25% of meetings will be contacted and possibly informed to TA. 

Next Step:

Our current format of having short meetings which identifies current progress and future objectives have worked reasonably well and will be maintained for future sprints. We will also be prepared to possibly change our group engagement format should the workload for each group member increases as the semester moves on. This may result in possible features to be dropped or postponed, however we will try our best to follow the schedule that is originally proposed. We will have our first meeting for sprint 1 meeting on 8:00pm EST Sunday January 30. The first meeting will likely be about an hour or two as we will begin to make decisions on who will implement the user stories and continue with regular meetings afterwards.
