Project Objectives:
We are designing an android app on which the users can play Black Jack against computer opponents. 
This app is intended as an alternative for people who like Black Jack but do not want to gamble real money, play online, and not be bombarded with advertisements. 

Key Users:
Junxiao Yu is a univeristy student and a new competitive black jack player. Junxiao in interested in developing his skills and knowledge about the game to prepare for tournaments. He is looking for a risk free way to play black jack without too many anoying ads.

Joshua Sutherland is your average janitor and family man, with a loving wife, and two kids. In his spare time he casually plays games on his phone to relax. Joshua wants to stop going to the casino and stop wasting money, so he is intersted in a new safer way to play black jack.

Key Scenarios:
Junxiao Yu can spend his time learing and thinking about the game, playing black jack against the computer. Without ads, Johnathan is less distracted and anoyed and is better able to pay attention.

Joshua Sutherland can casually play a few games of black jack instead of going to the casino. Joshua saves money and can spend more time with his family.
