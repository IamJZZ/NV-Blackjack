We are designing an android app on which the users can play various games like Black Jack. 
This app is intended as an alternative for people who like Black Jack but do not want to gamble real money. 
The users get to play against computer opponents. 
There is a chip system where bets can be made but no payments, everything will be free.
The players can use chips to buy in-game items that are saved to their accounts.
