Our app will be different by being completely free and having no ads.
Our app will be more liked by user who choose to play free game without having to spend real money but still want to gamble. 
One method to show that we are serious about no real money involved but still create a gambling atmosphere is by creating a daily login bonus gift that allows users to gain tokens so that user can be able to continue to play if user loses all their token.

One of the main reason why our competitors created an environment full of ads is because their primary goal is to generate profit. In addition, the same reason also is true on why competitors allow real money transaction. Thus, the two main advantage our app have over our competition is tightly related to non-profitable creation.
